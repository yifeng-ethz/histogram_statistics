### `BUG-001-R` Phase-5 queue-depth timing miss after FIFO expansion

- First seen in: Phase-5 standalone Quartus signoff after raising the ingress FIFO default to 256 entries.
- Symptom: slow-85 standalone setup slack missed timing on the histogram critical path.
- Root cause: the expanded FIFO/filter hot path and coalescing peak-level accounting left too much logic between registers.
- Fix status: fixed; registered the FIFO head in `hit_fifo`, replicated filter fields per ingress port, and updated `coalescing_queue` peak occupancy from the registered queue level.
- Evidence: standalone Quartus closes at slow-85 setup slack +0.129 ns; standalone DV remains `27 PASS, 0 FAIL`.
